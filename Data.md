## Data

The road network data is obtained from TIGER/Line Shapefiles for the selected counties of the state of Texas. The data sets can be also found directly using the Census FTP when having the county FIPS number. If you prefer to fetch multiple county road datasets you may use census_fetcher.py by Kathryn Killebrew.

Instead of other open source data such as OpenStreetMap, we decided to use TIGER/Line datasets due to better rural area coverage provided in this study. Therefore, a larger area of coverage in spatial information allowed for more details into the infrastructure available.
