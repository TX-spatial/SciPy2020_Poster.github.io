## Data

The road network data is obtained from [TIGER/Line Shapefiles](https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php?year=2019&layergroup=Roads) for the selected counties of the state of Texas. The data sets can be also found directly using the [Census FTP](https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2019/ROADS/) when having the [county FIPS number](https://tx.postcodebase.com/state_county). If you prefer to fetch multiple county road datasets you may use [census_fetcher.py](https://gist.github.com/flibbertigibbet/8092460) by Kathryn Killebrew. 

Instead of other open source data such as [OpenStreetMap](https://download.geofabrik.de/index.html), we decided to use TIGER/Line datasets due to better rural area coverage provided in this study. Therefore, a larger area of coverage in spatial information allowed for more details into the infrastructure available.
