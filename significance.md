## Significance

### Introduction
The need for having a road network in rural areas exits for a number of reasons including but not limited to finding shortest paths for delivering goods and transporting people to a single destination or possibly multiple destinations.  Regardless of the method sought in network analysis (shortest path or travelling salesman problem), purpose of the trip (water delivery between water wells and oil wells, alternatively delivering COVID-19 kits to people in rural areas) amongst a complete network is always more desired. 

### Objective
This study is aimed to develop an algorithm entirely in Jupyter notebooks for pre-processing TIGER/Line datasets in order to increase network completeness through coordinate truncation and proper segmentation of linestrings.  The developed approach is expected to prevent multiple subgraph formation for any given road network and allow shortest path analysis along with a more detailed and complete set of paths.
